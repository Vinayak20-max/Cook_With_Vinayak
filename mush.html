        <h3>RECIPE:</h3><br><br> <h4>Ingredients:</h4><br>
        <li>200 grams button mushrooms (cleaned and halved if large)</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour (maida)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder (optional)</li>
<li>½ teaspoon black pepper powder</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
<li>2 tablespoons cornflour (cornstarch)</li>
<li>½ cup breadcrumbs (or panko for extra crispiness)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon paprika or red chili powder</li>
<li> 2-3 tablespoons milk </li>
<li>Oil (for deep frying)</li>

<br><br>Preparing the Mushrooms:<br>
<br><br>Clean the Mushrooms:<br>
Wipe the mushrooms clean with a damp cloth or rinse them briefly under water. Pat dry completely. If the mushrooms are large, cut them in half.

<br><br>Season the Mushrooms:<br>
Lightly season the mushrooms with salt and pepper.

<br><br>Coating the Mushrooms:<br>
<br>Prepare the Dry Mix:<br>
In a bowl, mix all-purpose flour, cornflour, garlic powder, black pepper powder, paprika or red chili powder, and a pinch of salt.

<br><br>Prepare the Wet Mix:<br>
In a separate bowl, beat the egg (or use milk for a vegetarian option).

<br><br>Prepare the Breadcrumbs:<br>
Spread the breadcrumbs on a plate or shallow dish.

<br><br>Coat the Mushrooms:<br>

First, roll the mushrooms in the dry flour mixture to coat them evenly.
<br>Then, dip each mushroom in the beaten egg (or milk).
<br>Finally, coat them with breadcrumbs, pressing gently to ensure the breadcrumbs stick well. Repeat for all mushrooms.
<br><br>Frying the Mushrooms:<br>
<br><br>Heat the Oil:<br>
Heat oil in a deep frying pan or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Test the oil by dropping a small piece of bread; it should sizzle and rise to the surface.

<br><br>Fry the Mushrooms:<br>
Fry the crumb-coated mushrooms in small batches for 2-3 minutes, until they turn golden brown and crispy. Avoid overcrowding the pan.

<br><br>Drain the Mushrooms:<br>
Use a slotted spoon to remove the mushrooms and place them on paper towels to absorb excess oil.

<br><br>Serving:<br>
Serve the crumb-fried mushrooms hot with lemon wedges and your favorite dipping sauce, like garlic mayo, ketchup, or spicy aioli.
