        <h3>RECIPE:</h3><br><br> <h4>Ingredients:</h4><br>
        <li>2 cups sweet corn kernels (fresh or frozen)</li><br>
        <li>  3 tablespoons cornflour (cornstarch)</li><br>
        <li>  2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (maida)</li><br>
        <li>  1 teaspoon peri peri seasoning (store-bought or homemade)</li><br>
        <li>  ½ teaspoon red chili powder</li><br>
        <li> ½ teaspoon garlic powder (optional)</li><br>
        <li>  1 teaspoon lemon juice</li><br>
            <li>  Salt to taste</li><br>
            <li>  Oil (for deep frying)</li><br>
           <li> Fresh coriander leaves (for garnish)</li><br><br>
           <h4>Instructions:</h4>
           <br><br>Preparing the Corn:
           <br><br>If using fresh corn:<br> Boil the corn kernels in water for 3-4 minutes until slightly tender, then drain and pat dry.
           <br><br>If using frozen corn:<br> Thaw the corn by soaking it in warm water for 5 minutes, drain, and pat dry.
           <br><br> Coating the Corn:
           <br>In a mixing bowl, add the cornflour, all-purpose flour, red chili powder, garlic powder (if using), and salt.
           <br>Add the corn kernels to the bowl and toss them well, ensuring each kernel is coated evenly with the flour mixture. Add a few drops of water if needed to help the flour stick to the corn.
 <br><br>Frying the Corn:
<br>Heat oil in a deep pan or kadai over medium heat.
<br>Once the oil is hot, carefully add the coated corn in small batches. Fry the corn until golden and crispy, which should take about 4-5 minutes per batch.
<br>Use a slotted spoon to remove the fried corn and place it on a paper towel to drain excess oil.
<br><br> Tossing with Peri Peri Seasoning:
<br>While the corn is still hot, sprinkle the peri peri seasoning and lemon juice over the fried corn. Toss well to coat the corn evenly with the seasoning.
 <br><br>Serving:
<br>Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and serve immediately while hot and crispy.
