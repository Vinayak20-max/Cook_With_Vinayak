        <h3>RECIPE:</h3><br><br> <h4>Ingredients:</h4><br>
        <li>1 cup raw peanuts (with or without skin)
            <li>4 tablespoons gram flour (besan)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons rice flour (for extra crispiness)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chaat masala (optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oil (for binding)</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Water (to make the batter)</li>
            <li>Oil (for deep frying or a few teaspoons for baking)</li>
            <li>Fresh curry leaves (optional, for frying)</li><br><br><br>
            <h4>Instructions:</h4>
            <br><br>1. Preparing the Batter:<br><br>
            <br>Mix the Dry Ingredients:<br>
In a large bowl, combine gram flour (besan), rice flour, red chili powder, turmeric powder, cumin powder, coriander powder, and salt. Mix well.

<br><br>Add Peanuts:<br>
Add the raw peanuts to the bowl and toss them with the dry flour mixture so that each peanut is lightly coated.

<br><br>Make the Batter:<br>
Drizzle the oil over the peanuts and then gradually sprinkle a few tablespoons of water over the mixture. Mix well until the peanuts are coated with a thick, sticky batter. Be careful not to add too much water; you want just enough to bind the flour to the peanuts.
<br><br><br>
2. Frying Method:<br>
<br><br>Heat Oil:<br>
Heat oil in a deep pan or kadai over medium heat. Test the oil by dropping a small piece of batter; it should sizzle and rise to the surface.

<br><br>Fry the Peanuts:<br>
Carefully drop small batches of the batter-coated peanuts into the hot oil. You can also add a few curry leaves to the oil for extra flavor. Fry the peanuts, stirring occasionally, until they turn golden and crispy. This should take about 4-5 minutes per batch.

<br><br>Drain Excess Oil:<br>
Use a slotted spoon to remove the fried peanuts from the oil and place them on paper towels to drain the excess oil.

<br><br><br>3. Baking Method (Healthier Option):<br>
<br>Preheat the Oven:<br>
Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly grease it.

<br><br>Bake the Peanuts:<br>
Spread the batter-coated peanuts in a single layer on the baking sheet. Drizzle a little oil on top. Bake for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the peanuts are golden and crispy.
<br><br><br>
4. Final Touch:<br><br>
Sprinkle Chaat Masala:<br>
Once the fried or baked peanuts have cooled slightly, sprinkle chaat masala over them and toss to coat.

<br><br>Serve:<br>
Serve the masala peanuts warm or at room temperature as a snack.
