        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>½ tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>¾ cup sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup oil (vegetable or sunflower)</li>

        <h5>For the Filling and Topping:</h5><br>

        <li>1 cup chopped canned pineapple (or fresh pineapple)</li>
        <li>8-10 pineapple slices (for decoration)</li>
        <li> ¼ cup chopped cherries (optional, for garnish)</li><br>
        <h4>Instructions:</h4><br>
        <p><br><br><br>1. Make the Sponge Cake:<br><br><br>

            Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line a rectangular cake pan (9x13 inch).
            <br><br>In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, and baking soda.
            <br><br>In a separate bowl, whisk eggs and sugar until pale and fluffy.
            <br><br>Add oil, vanilla extract, and milk to the egg mixture and mix well.
            <br><br>Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture until you have a smooth batter.
            <br><br> Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
            <br><br> Let the cake cool completely before cutting.
            <br><br><br> 2. Prepare the Pineapple Syrup:<br><br>
            
            In a small saucepan, combine pineapple juice and sugar. Heat over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Let it cool.
            <br><br><br>3. Assemble the Pastry:<br><br>
            
            Once the cake is cooled, slice it into equal-sized rectangular pieces.
            <br> Generously brush each cake slice with the pineapple syrup to make it moist.
            <br> Spread whipped cream on top of each slice, then add a layer of chopped pineapple.
            <br><br><br>  4. Decorate:<br><br>
            
            Frost the top and sides of the pastries with more whipped cream.
            <br>Place pineapple slices on top of each pastry and garnish with cherries for a classic look.
            <br>Optionally, sprinkle some pineapple pieces or additional whipped cream on top for extra flair.
            <br><br><br>5. Chill and Serve:<br><br>
            
            Refrigerate the pineapple pastries for at least 1-2 hours before serving, allowing the flavors to blend.
            <br><br><br><br>Enjoy your light and fluffy Pineapple Pastries with their refreshing tropical flavor!</p>
