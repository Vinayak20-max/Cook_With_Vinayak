        <h3>RECIPE:</h3><br><br> <h4>Ingredients:</h4><br>
        <li>4-5 large potatoes (russet or Idaho potatoes work best)</li>
        <li> Cold water (for soaking)</li>
        <li>3-4 cups oil (for deep frying)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Optional seasoning (paprika, garlic powder, black pepper, etc.)</li><br><br>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        Preparing the Potatoes:
        <br><br>Peel and Cut the Potatoes:
        <br>Peel the potatoes and cut them into thin sticks, about ¼ inch wide, resembling classic French fries.

        <br><br>Soak in Cold Water:
        <br>Place the cut potatoes in a bowl of cold water and let them soak for at least 30 minutes (you can soak for up to 1-2 hours). This removes excess starch and helps the fries become crispy when fried.

        <br><br>Dry the Potatoes:
        <br>After soaking, drain the potatoes and pat them completely dry using a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. Ensure there’s no moisture left on the potatoes.

        <br><br>First Fry (Blanching the Fries):
        <br><br>Heat Oil:
        <br>Heat oil in a deep frying pan or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat to about 300°F (150°C). You don’t want the oil too hot during the first fry.

        <br><br>Blanch the Fries:
        <br>Fry the potatoes in batches for about 3-4 minutes, until they are soft but not browned. This step is to cook the potatoes through without adding color. Remove the fries and drain on a paper towel.

        <br><br>Let the Fries Cool:
        <br>Let the fries cool for at least 15 minutes. You can refrigerate them for 30 minutes to an hour if you have time (this helps get the fries even crispier later).

        <br><br>Second Fry (Crisping the Fries):
        <br>Increase the Heat:
        <br>Reheat the oil to 350°F (180°C). This higher temperature will help crisp up the fries.

        <br><br>Fry Again:
        <br>Fry the blanched fries in batches until they turn golden brown and crispy. This should take about 2-4 minutes per batch. Keep an eye on them to avoid burning.

        <br><br>Drain and Season:
        <br>Remove the fries from the oil and place them on paper towels to drain excess oil. While they’re still hot, season with salt and any other spices you like (paprika, garlic powder, or black pepper work well).

<br><br> Serve:<br>
Serve the hot, crispy French fries with your favorite dipping sauce like ketchup, mayonnaise, or any dip of your choice.
