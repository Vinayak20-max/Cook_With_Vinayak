        <h4>Instructions:</h4><br>
        <p><br><br>1. Make the Chocolate Sponge Cake:<br><br>

            Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line a rectangular cake pan (9x13 inch).
            <br><br>In a large bowl, sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and baking soda.
            <br><br> In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and sugar until light and fluffy.
            <br><br>Add oil, vanilla extract, and milk to the egg mixture and whisk until combined.
            <br><br>Gradually fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture, stirring until smooth.
            <br><br>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
            <br><br> Let the cake cool completely.
            <br><br><br>2. Prepare the Chocolate Syrup:<br><br>
            
            In a small saucepan, combine water, sugar, and cocoa powder.
            <br> Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.
            <br> Let it cool.
            <br><br><br>3. Make the Chocolate Ganache:<br><br>
            
            <br>Heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until it starts to simmer (do not boil).
            <br>Pour the hot cream over the chocolate chips in a heatproof bowl and let sit for 1-2 minutes.
            <br> Stir until the chocolate is melted and the ganache is smooth. Let it cool to thicken slightly.
            <br><br><br> 4. Assemble the Pastry:<br><br>
            
            Once the cake is completely cool, slice it into rectangular or square pieces.
            <br>Brush each slice generously with the chocolate syrup to make it moist.
            <br>Spread a layer of whipped cream between two cake slices to make a sandwich.
            <br><br><br>5. Frost with Ganache:<br><br>
            
            Pour the cooled, thickened chocolate ganache over the top of each pastry, letting it drip down the sides for a glossy finish.
            <br><br><br> 6. Decorate:<br><br>
            
            Top each pastry with whipped cream swirls and sprinkle chocolate shavings or curls for an elegant touch.
            <br><br><br>7. Chill and Serve:<br><br>
            
            Refrigerate the pastries for at least 1-2 hours before serving, allowing the flavors to set.
            <br><br><br><br>Enjoy your rich and indulgent Chocolate Pastries! Perfect for any special occasion or just to satisfy a chocolate craving.</p>
