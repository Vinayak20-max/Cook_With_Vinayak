        <h3>RECIPE:</h3><br><br> <h4>Ingredients:</h4><br>
        <li>4 slices of bread (any kind, but white or whole wheat works well)</li><br>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter (softened)</li><br>
        <li>2-3 garlic cloves (minced)<br><br>
        <li>  1 tablespoon olive oil (optional, for extra flavor)</li><br>
        <li>  1 teaspoon dried parsley or oregano (optional)</li><br>
        <li>  A pinch of salt</li><br>
        <li>  Grated cheese (optional for cheesy garlic bread)</li><br>

        <p>Instructions:<br>
            Prepare the Garlic Butter Mixture:

            <br><br>In a small bowl, combine the softened butter, minced garlic, olive oil (if using), parsley/oregano, and a pinch of salt.
<br><br>Mix thoroughly until it forms a smooth, spreadable garlic butter.
<br><br><br><br>Spread the Garlic Butter:

<br><br>Spread the garlic butter mixture evenly on one side of each bread slice. You can adjust the amount of garlic butter based on how garlicky and buttery you want your bread.
<br><br>Toast the Bread:

<br><br><br><br>Option 1: Stovetop
<br><br>Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat. Place the buttered side of the bread slices down in the pan. Toast for 2-3 minutes until golden brown and crispy. Flip and toast the other side for about 1-2 minutes.

<br><br><br><br>Option 2: Oven
<br><br>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Place the bread slices on a baking sheet, buttered side up. Bake for 8-10 minutes until the edges are golden and crispy. For a crispier texture, broil for an additional 1-2 minutes.

<br><br><br><br>Optional Cheesy Garlic Bread:

<br><br>If you want cheesy garlic bread, after the bread is toasted, sprinkle grated cheese (like mozzarella or Parmesan) on top of the buttered side, and broil in the oven until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
<br><br><br><br>Serve:

<br><br>Serve the garlic bread warm with your favorite dip, soup, or pasta!
<br><br><br><br>Enjoy your quick and easy garlic bread made with sliced bread!</p>
