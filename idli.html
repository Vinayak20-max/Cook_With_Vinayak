        <h3>RECIPE:</h3><br><br> <h4>Ingredients:</h4><br>
        <li>2 cups idli rice (or regular rice)</li>
        <li> ½ cup urad dal (whole or split black lentils)</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (methi seeds, optional)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li> Water (for soaking and grinding)</li>
        <li> Oil (for greasing the idli plates)</li><br>
        <h4>Instructions:</h4><br>
        <br>Soaking the Ingredients:
        <br><br>Wash and Soak Rice:
        <br>Rinse the idli rice thoroughly in water a few times until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in enough water for 4-6 hours.

        <br><br>Soak Urad Dal and Fenugreek Seeds:<br>
Rinse the urad dal and fenugreek seeds (if using). Soak them together in enough water for 4-6 hours, separate from the rice.

<br><br>Grinding the Batter:<br>
Grind Urad Dal:
Drain the water from the urad dal. Using a wet grinder or high-power blender, grind the urad dal into a smooth and fluffy batter. Add water gradually (about ½-1 cup), and ensure the batter is light and airy. It should have a thick yet flowing consistency.

<br><br>Grind the Rice:<br>
Drain the soaked rice. Grind it to a slightly coarse, grainy texture using a wet grinder or blender, adding water as needed. The rice batter should be thicker than the urad dal batter, but still spreadable.

<br><br>Combine the Batter:<br>
Mix the rice batter and urad dal batter together in a large bowl. Add salt and mix thoroughly using your hand (this helps in fermentation). The batter should be thick but not too watery.

<br><br>Fermenting the Batter:<br>
<br><br>Fermentation:<br>
Cover the bowl and let the batter ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours (or overnight) until it doubles in size and becomes bubbly. In cold weather, place the batter in an oven with the light on to aid fermentation.
<br><br>Steaming the Idlis:<br>
<br>Prepare the Idli Steamer:<br>
Grease the idli plates with a little oil to prevent sticking. Pour the fermented batter into the molds, filling each about ¾ full.

<br><br>Steam the Idlis:<br>
Heat water in the idli steamer or pressure cooker (without the whistle/weight) and let it come to a boil. Place the idli plates in the steamer, cover, and steam the idlis for about 10-15 minutes on medium heat.

<br><br>Check for Doneness:<br>
To check if the idlis are done, insert a toothpick or knife into one of the idlis. If it comes out clean, the idlis are cooked. Remove the plates and let them cool for a minute.

<br><br>Remove the Idlis:<br>
Use a spoon or knife to gently scoop the idlis out of the molds.
